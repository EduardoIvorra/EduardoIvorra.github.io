							<h2>About me as an enthusiast Learner<br />
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Since the moment I started my career I realised that it was totally necessary to add more value and skills to all the knowledge I was learning. So I decided to learn as an autodidact in all the programming languages, frameworks and tools that I was interested. These are some of them and how I think I am in such tool.</p>

                          <p>These are the ones that I'm most interested on continue learning, but I'm also worked with Angular, Spring Boot, C, Scala, Pascal, Android Studio, R...</p>
                          <p>At my work, I'm on the Architect Cloud team, so I'm fastly learning about AWS, AZURE and GCP. Right now AWS is a priority to me and my job so I'm putting all my efforts in knowing this tool deeply.</p>
                          <p>So I'm basically trying to learn a lot of things, enjoying the way discovering all the things that I like and don't. So I try to put some more percentage to the skill bars above in each field, but my priorities rihgt now, apart of AWS because of my job, are React, NodeJS and containers (DOCKER/K8S), in that order.</p>
                          <p>I'm also learning about devOps, improving my soft skills and put my English in the next level. It might be a lot of stuff but I'm going slowly in this journey, I also love Sport, movies, and being with friends, is a question of organization.  </p>
